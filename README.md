This work introduces a radical, post-continuum paradigm: the phi-BASIN framework. This framework posits that spacetime, gauge symmetries, and particle masses are strictly macroscopic, low-energy projections of a deterministic, 26-dimensional computational crystal operating on the substrate of the 24-dimensional Leech lattice (Lambda_24).
